### 9/30/24: Day 1
* Welcome to Day 1 of the learning log. My tool for the freedom project I'm going to make will be Kaboom. To start off I created an html file and created a fullscreen Kaboom canvas using this screenshot below![](screenshot1.png)
After checking using `http-server` it was showing the right thing. I also learned that that's the easier way to get started with setting up Kaboom.

We're in the same day, but I changed the text and position of the text that's shown which is "Hello Kaboom". I tried challenging myself by trying to make the text centered in the middle.

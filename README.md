# SEP11 Freedom Project
by **Alvin Frias**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to independently study **Kaboom.js** in order to help me make **my 2D Platformer that moves platforms**.

## Implications
##### PROS
* Social/Game
    * This is a unique platformer that allows the users to play like never before.
    * Very strategic gameplay with the snail and the friction
    * Reduces stress levels
    * Blue mountains that were drawn add cold elements to the environment the sprite is in.
    * Provides instructions for users to follow to win the game
* Global
    * This is a digital game, so nothing physical like paper is actually damaged in this game.
##### CONS
* Game
    * Some people may not understand the instructions in the game
    * This game's friction can confuse people and they might not know how to win
    * When you recieve an alert, the users won't know to not press any keys during the alert screen. If they press keys, it's an automatic game over screen after pressing "OK" on the alert
* Social
    * Possible addiction

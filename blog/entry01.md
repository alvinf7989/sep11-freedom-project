Hello everyone! Welcome to my first blog entry for my next **Freedom Project!** For those of you that don't know, we did something like this in our last Freedom Project back in SEP10 where we wrote blog entries for our Freedom Project. In this entry, we wil talk about how I tinkered with my tool.

## My Tool
Before we talk about the tool I chose, we have to go back to the context we had. Before we were assigned blog entries, we were already given a tool and idea to make out of a tool and Javascript. I chose to make a 2D Platformer using the tool: **Kaboom.js**. So far, on [my Learning Log](tool/learning-log.md), I took 2 days to log in my activity with the tool. And if you look at the date I did these logs in, they don't look that good as my recent log was almost a month from the first log. Now since we have the whole week to finish this entry, I'm just going to create another log. But that's enough blabbering let's go through my logs.

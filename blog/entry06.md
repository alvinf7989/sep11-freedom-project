# Entry 6
##### 05/27/2025
This is it people! This is the final blog entry of my Freedom Project. Here I will explain the things I did Beyond MVP to my Freedom Project as well as the presentation and the elevator Expo, which I did not know was the day I started writing this blog entry.

## My Final Touches on Freedom project
Okay, so recently there has been an activity where students from our class walk around our laptops and test out our freedom projects. They would offer feedback which helped me improve. Some students said that in my game, it was not clear of how they would be able to win in it. This is because of the snail's friction issues and that there was no clear instructions.

To improve, I added an `alert()` that tells the users all the instructions they need to win the game and that they "must be strategic"

# Entry 4
##### 3/10/2025

We are so back with another entry from yours truly, Alvin Frias! In my 4th entry, prepare to hear me talk about my two days that I was working with my Freedom Project because Practice files are over. I even created my own sprite.

## Plan
As we all know, there are no more days to practice your tool because as of March 2025, we should know how to work on our Freedom Project. As you guys know, my idea was a 2D Platformer and what made this different was that the user can move the platforms and just have the sprite jump to avoid any gaps or obstacles.

Before I got to working, I created a plan for my project on MVP & Beyond. The plan was simple and it was to create one level using my ideas of this 2D Platformer. I broke this into 4 steps:
* [x] Create Obstacles using Kaboom (deadline: 3/20)
* [x] Create a Sprite in Photoshop (deadline: 3/8)
* [ ] Make my sprite be interactable by user (deadline: 3/15)
* [ ] Create background (deadline: 4/1)

The first two of these steps are currently done, but I do have steps for beyond MVP:
* Create Background Music using Ableton Live
* Create Unique Obstacles in Photoshop
* Create Background in Photoshop

Yeah, I wanted to use a lot of other apps to put into my project.

# Entry 4
##### 3/10/2025

We are so back with another entry from yours truly, Alvin Frias! In my 4th entry, prepare to hear me talk about my two days that I was working with my Freedom Project because Practice files are over. I even created my own sprite.

## Plan
As we all know, there are no more days to practice your tool because as of March 2025, we should know how to work on our Freedom Project. As you guys know, my idea was a 2D Platformer and what made this different was that the user can move the platforms and just have the sprite jump to avoid any gaps or obstacles.

Before I got to working, I created a plan for my project on MVP & Beyond. The plan was simple and it was to create one level using my ideas of this 2D Platformer.
